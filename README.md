# Solidity.Roslyn

This library allows you to generate C# wrapper over Solidity contracts, targeting netstandard library. 
It requires `solc` available in PATH when building.
You can install it for your OS ([see instruction](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/installing-solidity.html)) or use prebuilt [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pzixel/solidity-dotnet/).
